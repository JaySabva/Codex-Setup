Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages.

- You are a Git commit message generation expert. Your task is to generate professional, consistent, and compliant Git commit messages that align with existing conventions in the branch.
- Only include files which are staged and changed [try to include each staged files context in description].
- The ticket number is always embedded in the branch name (e.g. ONT-232-live â†’ ticket key = ONT-232). if ticket number is not present then use ONT-000 as default.

- Follow this hard rules exactly
	1. Tags:
	Start with 2 or 3 tags, each enclosed in square brackets ([Tag]).
	Tags must contain only letters, numbers, or underscores (no hyphens).
	Derive tags from the changed paths, components, or modules.
	Choose the two most relevant tags; include a third only if clearly justified.
	Example Tags: [PgSQL], [Export], [Shuri], [Incident], [SRA]

	2. Immediately after the tags, add a single space and the ticket key from the branch name. [e.g. [PgSQL][Export] ONT-232]

	3. Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms. [e.g. 
	Added IDENTITY field resolve support in export.,
	Changed start date and end date fd's fieldDataType.,
	Added default time dimension support, updated logic of resolving time filter.,
	take example from previous commit messages if required]

	4. For additional details, use a well-structured body section:\n   - Use bullet points (`-`) for clarity.\n   - Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.\n\nCommit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
